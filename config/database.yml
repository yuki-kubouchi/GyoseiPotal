# MySQL. Versions 5.5.8 and up are supported.
#
# Install the MySQL driver
#   gem install mysql2
#
# Ensure the MySQL gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem "mysql2"
#
# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:

development:
  <<: *default
  database: gyosei_potal_development

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: gyosei_potal_test

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
# variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# URL environment variable explicitly:
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= ENV['RENDER_DATABASE_NAME'] || 'gyosei_potal_production' %>
  username: <%= ENV['RENDER_DATABASE_USERNAME'] || 'gyosei_potal_user' %>
  password: <%= ENV['RENDER_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
  host: <%= ENV['RENDER_DATABASE_HOST'] %>
#
# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full overview on how database connection configuration can be specified.
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: gyosei_potal_production
  username: gyosei_potal
  password: <%= ENV["GYOSEI_POTAL_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
